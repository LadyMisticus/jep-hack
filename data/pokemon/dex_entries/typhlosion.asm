; Extremely abridged version of the infamous Typhlosion story from the DP development docs.
; Based on the Bear Mother story from Canadian First Nations mythology. I chose to blend it with the mythology of the very similar Mujina (è²‰).
; I chose Typhlosion over Hisuian Typhlosion to be consistent with the time period in which the lore was devised.
; However, as a dex entry, it's quite poor. I think this could be modified and tweaked.
