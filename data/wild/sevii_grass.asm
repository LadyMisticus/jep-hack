; Sevii Pok√©mon in grass

; General philosophies:
; - Alolan Pokemon will be encounterable, as the Sevii Islands are a tropical area.
; - It's still Kanto, so we will feature more Kanto than Johto Pokemon. Basically, this will use the "classic Johto" philosophy of hiding them in the back. 
; - Minimal, if any, Nihon Pokemon.
